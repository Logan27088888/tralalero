    <h2>Tralalero Tralala (rarely Tralalelo Tralala) (Italian: Trallallero Trallallà) is one of the original italian brainrot animals.

        Tralalelo Tralala is a one-of-a-kind shark with three legs—two replacing its side fins and a third at the end of its tail. Instead of swimming like other sharks, it strides across the ocean floor with surprising agility. Adding to its uniqueness, Tralalelo sports a pair of stylish blue Nike shoes, giving it both grip and undeniable swagger as it moves through the deep.</h2>
